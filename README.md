# Broadcast WA Tips

## 1200 BC at a time
The broadcast I started was named 'Storyboard Broadcast' and currently has 4000 members. As you know, a single broadcast has a limit of 256 people, and thus I had to create 16 such lists to accommodate all the 4000 subscribers. It has been 6 months since I started broadcasting and I have been getting positive reviews about the service.

The problems I have been facing are multiple.

1. I am not able to broadcast to every 4000 members at once. Having 16 lists is okay, but when I send a message to almost 5 lists, I have to wait exactly 11 minutes , before I can send to the next 5. This means I will have to wait more than 45 minutes to send a message to the whole 4000 members. I searched the internet about this problem, and found out that I can only broadcast to 1200 people at a moment. 

2. The second problem is a part of the first problem. 5 lists x 256 members = 1280 members. Since the message is only received by 1200 members at once, the other 80 members doesn't receive the message even though a single 'tick' appears on their conversation. I will be posting screenshots about members complaining of not getting the update, even when it is in their conversation.

More than 5 messages per minute are very risky.

## IMPORTANT For BLOCKED WHATSAPP!

1. Use a WhatsApp number that has been unblocked for chatting for a minimum of 3 days.
2. After feeling secure, contact Wablas admin to request transfer the server.
3. After the transfer, try using WhatsApp Desktop or WhatsApp Web for about 2 days.
4. If you feel secure, try scanning on Wablas Device.
5. After successfully scanning on Wablas, try sending a few messages every day, 1-3 messages per day, for several days.
6. Ensure that the "Speed Sending Message" in device settings is above 15.
7. If everything feels safe, gradually increase the number of messages sent every day. Keep using the WA application to reply to messages as well.

## Is there a WhatsApp send limit?
Yes, WhatsApp has a messaging limit. This is the highest number of conversations a business can initiate with a phone number in a rolling period of 24 hours.

Initially, business phone numbers can only contact 250 users in a 24-hour moving period. But this number can be increased gradually by following a few practices and meeting the required criteria.

## Ways to Apply for a WhatsApp Green Tick Badge
You can either apply for a WhatsApp green tick verification on your META Business Manager or with the help of a Business Service Provider (BSPs) like Wati.

### Meta Business Manager
1. In your META Business Manager, go to Business Settings -> WhatsApp Accounts -> WhatsApp Manager.
2. Under Account tools, select ‘phone number’.
3. On the next page, you’ll find your WhatsApp account details. Click the ‘Settings’ icon to proceed.
4. Click ‘Profile’, fill in all the details and click the ‘Submit Request’ button.
5. Once the request is submitted, you can see that your request is in review status.

If you apply for a green tick independently, it usually takes 2-4 business days to know if your application was accepted.[source](https://www.wati.io/blog/whatsapp-green-tick-verification/)
