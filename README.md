rule of thumb

The broadcast I started was named 'Storyboard Broadcast' and currently has 4000 members. As you know, a single broadcast has a limit of 256 people, and thus I had to create 16 such lists to accommodate all the 4000 subscribers. It has been 6 months since I started broadcasting and I have been getting positive reviews about the service.

The problems I have been facing are multiple.

1. I am not able to broadcast to every 4000 members at once. Having 16 lists is okay, but when I send a message to almost 5 lists, I have to wait exactly 11 minutes , before I can send to the next 5. This means I will have to wait more than 45 minutes to send a message to the whole 4000 members. I searched the internet about this problem, and found out that I can only broadcast to 1200 people at a moment. 

2. The second problem is a part of the first problem. 5 lists x 256 members = 1280 members. Since the message is only received by 1200 members at once, the other 80 members doesn't receive the message even though a single 'tick' appears on their conversation. I will be posting screenshots about members complaining of not getting the update, even when it is in their conversation.



More than 5 messages per minute are very risky.
